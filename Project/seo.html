<!-- Meta Tags for Metadata: -->

<!-- Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage. They are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and are not visible to users but are used by browsers, search engines, and other web services to gather information about the page. Here are some common uses of meta tags: -->

<!-- <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the webpage, ensuring proper rendering of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport properties for responsive design.

<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage">: Provides a concise description of the page's content.

<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: Specifies relevant keywords for search engines (not as impactful as it used to be).

<meta name="author" content="Author's Name">: Indicates the author of the webpage.

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">: Instructs search engine robots (also known as crawlers or spiders)  whether to index and follow links on the page. -->
